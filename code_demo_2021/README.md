Live coding demo
================

During the theory session, we have live-coded a solution to [Advent of Code, 2015, day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5). After the session, Babak Firoozi Fooladi has shared a solution of his own, further exploring his idea of using a Pandas `DataFrame`. You can find both solutions in this folder to compare and contrast the different approaches taken.
